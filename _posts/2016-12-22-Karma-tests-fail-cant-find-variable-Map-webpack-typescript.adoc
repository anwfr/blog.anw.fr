## Problem
Karma tests fail with the following error:

**Can't find variable: Map**



## Solution
Load babel-polyfill in your tests context, by adding this to your karma.conf.js:
```
...
        files: [
            'node_modules/babel-polyfill/dist/polyfill.min.js', // ES6 compatibility
            'tests/**/*.ts'
        ],
```

IMPORTANT: order matters, make sure babel-polyfill is declared upper your typescript tests in your karma configuration.
