= react-router 4 + hashHistory not working (link not rendering view, view rendered after refresh)

:hp-alt-title: react-router 4 hashHistory link not rendering view rendered after refresh
:published_at: 2018-01-27

## Problem
With react-router 4 and hashHistory, clicking on a <Link> updates URL and state but view is not rendered. After browser refresh, view is correctly rendered.

## Solution
 * Make sure to use <HashRouter> (from react-router-dom) instead of <Router>
 * If <Link> is not direct child of HashRouter, connect the component with withRouter() (see https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/dealing-with-update-blocking)
 
 
history & reducer & router configuration:
```javascript
import {applyMiddleware, createStore, combineReducers} from 'redux';
import {routerMiddleware, syncHistoryWithStore, routerReducer} from 'react-router-redux';
import {createHashHistory} from 'history';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  //custom reducers here ...
  routing: routerReducer // IMPORTANT: naming "routing"
})

let hashHistory = createHashHistory()
const router = routerMiddleware(hashHistory);
const enhancer = applyMiddleware(router);
const store = createStore(rootReducer, initialState, enhancer);

// Create an enhanced history that syncs navigation events with the store
const history = syncHistoryWithStore(hashHistory, store)

export { store, history };
```

Root component:
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import {Provider} from 'react-redux'
import {HashRouter, withRouter} from 'react-router-dom'
import Routes from './routes'
import {store} from './store/configureStore'

const App = (props) => {
  var RoutesSync = withRouter(Routes) // IMPORTANT: use withRouter()
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <HashRouter> // IMPORTANT: use HashRouter
        <RoutesSync />
      </HashRouter>
    </Provider>
  )
}
export default App
```
 
Sub component:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {Route, Switch} from 'react-router';
import {connect} from "react-redux";

const Routes = (props) => {
    return (
        <Switch>
            <Route path='/foo' component={foo} />
            ... all routes here ...
        </Switch>
    )
}
export default Routes

```
 
Linking component:
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import {Link} from 'react-router-dom'

const MyComponent = (props) => {
    return (
    <div>
        <Link to='/foo'>Foo</Link>
    </div>
    )
}

export default MyComponent
```
