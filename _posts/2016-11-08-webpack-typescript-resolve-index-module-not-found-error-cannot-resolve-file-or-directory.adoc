= Unable to resolve index.ts with webpack (Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve 'file' or 'directory')

:published_at: 2016-11-08

## Problem
With the following file structure :

```
src/
|- app.ts
|- store/index.ts
```

The following require instruction doesn't work in app.ts:

```
import foo from './store'
```

**ERROR in ./app.ts
Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve 'file' or 'directory' ./store in /src
 @ ./src/app.ts 4:14-32**


But the following instruction works:

```
import foo from './store/index.ts'
```

Webpack doesn't automatically resolve import paths to /index.ts


## Solution
Add this to your webpack.config.js :


```
module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['', '.js', '.ts']
  }
}
```
