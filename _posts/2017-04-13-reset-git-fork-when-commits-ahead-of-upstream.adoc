:published_at: 2017-04-13

## Problem
Forked repository is X commits ahead upstream, everything is f*cked up. You want to reset it from upstream.


## Solution
Example with master. Repeat for every branch to reset.
```
git remote add upstream https://....
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git reset --hard upstream/master  
git push origin master --force 
```
