= [Fixed] Synchronizing Living Colors gen2, remotes, Philips Hue and bridge 2.0 together
:hp-tags: hardware,fixed

*THE PROBLEM:* I spent a few hours getting all this stuff working together:

* Living Colors and Living Bloom gen2 
* Living Colors remote gen2 (round remote with the "touch-wheel" for colors)
* Philips Hue white/color bulbs
* Philips bridge v2


There are almost no post on internet about this and instructions for remote v1 doesn't work, so here is the trick:

0. Plug and turn everything on

1. Reset the Living Color remote:
press the reset button under the battery cover for a few seconds.

2. Reset the Hue Bridge: 
(this will remove all settings, scenes, schedules, rules, etc. from the Hue Bridge): while holding the link button on top of the Hue Bridge, hold the remote close to the Hue Bridge and hold "0" (off) and Blue on colorwheel (-6h) until the Hue Bridge reboots.

3. Associate the Living Color remote with each Living Colors lights and Hue bulbs: 
hold the remote near each item holding the "I" (on) until the item stops blinking.
At this point, you can control all items with the remote, but your bridge doesn't detect Living Colors.

4. Associate the Living Color remote with the Hue bridge: 
press the link button on top of the Hue Bridge and hold the "I" (on) on the remote until the LED around bridge's link button stops blinking.

5. Open Hue app, your remote and living colors will be detected!



For adding an additional remote:
1. Reset the new Living Color remote:
press the reset button under the battery cover for a few seconds.

2. Associate the remotes together: hold the new remote close to the already configured one and hold the "I" (on) of both remotes until they stop blinking.
